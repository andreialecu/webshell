import { WebView } from '../components/ReactReference';
import { APIReference } from '../components/APIReference';

## Can I get the `ref` of the <WebView />?

**Yes**. `Webshell` component already forwards the reference of the underlying <WebView />. Just use `ref` prop as you would with a <WebView />!

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const webViewRef = useRef(null);
  return <Webshell ref={webViewRef} />;
}
```

## Can I set Feature Options Dynamically?

**Yes**. `React.useMemo` is your friend:

```jsx
function MyComponent({ option, ...props }) {
  const Webshell = React.useMemo(() =>
    makeWebshell(WebView, new Feature({ dynamicOption: option })),
    [option]
  );
  return <Webshell {...props} />;
}
```

## Can I Pass Custom Props to WebViews?

**Yes**. [Read this guide: Native to Web Communication](./implementing-features#native-to-web-communication).

## Will a Shell Pass `injectedJavaScript` Prop?

**Yes**. <APIReference reference="WebshellComponent" type="alias" /> will pass any
`injectedJavaScript` prop to the underlying <WebView/>, along with scripts
bundled from features.

## Will a Shell Account for `onMessage` Handler Prop?

**Yes**. It will intercept specific events created by features, and hoist any
message which doesn't comply to very specific requirements towards the controlling
component.

## Isn't `HandleOnLinkPressFeature` redundant with `onNavigationStateChange` prop?

**Somehow**. But <APIReference reference="HandleOnLinkPressFeature" type="variable" /> is more reliable. On Android, calling `webView.stopLoading()` [will disable further taps from the same page](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54115883/2779871), leading to a lot of undesired behaviors.
