## ForceElementSizeFeature

<APIBox reference="ForceElementSizeFeature" type="variable" />

This feature sets element size programmatically and only once, when
[DOMContentLoaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded)
has been fired.

## ForceResponsiveViewportFeature

<APIBox reference="ForceResponsiveViewportFeature" type="variable" />

This feature inserts or replace a meta element looking like:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
```

This will guarantee that the layout viewport will match
device-width (hence, “responsive”). Minimum scale is locked to 1, but you
can customize maximum scale to allow pinch-zoom gestures.
See [MDN—Using the viewport meta tag ...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag).

## HandleElementCSSBoxFeature

<APIBox reference="HandleElementCSSBoxFeature" type="variable" />

This feature enables receiving the [CSS Box dimensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model) of an element in the
`WebView` pixels unit. The first element matching the provided tagName is
retained. A new event will be triggered on every resize.

If you are looking for the document content size, use <APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" /> instead.

## HandleHashChangeFeature

<APIBox reference="HandleHashChangeFeature" type="variable" />

This feature allows to intercept `hashchange` events, when the hash fragment of the URL changes.
This could happen when the user clicks on anchors like this:

```html
<a href="#subresource">Let's Jump to Subresource</a>
```

Or when JavaScript code imperatively changes the hash fragment of current location.
See [MDN—hashchange event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event).

## HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature

<APIBox reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" />

This feature enables receiving various dimensions relative to the layout. The events
will only be fired when a change is observed to either the layout or the content size.

If you need to guarantee that 1 CSS pixel = 1 Device pixel, you should use this
feature with a meta tag viewport setting width to device width.
See <APIReference reference="ForceResponsiveViewportFeature" type="variable" />.

## HandleLinkPressFeature

<APIBox reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />

This feature allows to intercept clicks on anchors such as:

```html
<a href="https://domain.com/">Let's Travel</a>
```

By default, it will prevent the click from propagating. But you can disable
this option.

If you need to intercept click on hash fragments, consider <APIReference reference="HandleHashChangeFeature" type="variable" /> instead.

## HandleVisualViewportFeature

<APIBox reference="HandleVisualViewportFeature" type="variable" />

This feature adds a handler triggered when the visual viewport changes. It
requires `VisualViewport` API support on browsers (iOS Safari 13 and Android WebView 62).
See [MDN—VisualViewport API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VisualViewport).
