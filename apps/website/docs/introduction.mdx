## Compatibility

:::important
**@formidable-webview/webshell** requires React Native 0.59+ or expo SDK 33.0+.
:::

:::important
We officially support the most up to date version of
[react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview).
There is a compatibility layer for [the deprecated WebView component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/webview) exported by
react-native, but things might break.

## Prerequisites

To have a good understanding of this library capabilities, you are highly encouraged, if not already, to familiarize with the following:

- React <Term id="hoc" title="Higher Order Components"/> (HOC);
- React <Term id="hooks"/>;
- <Term id="dom" title="Document Object Model" /> (DOM).

## Motivations

With React Native becoming an incredibly popular framework to build mobile
applications, the <WebView /> component has become a central piece for many
applications relying on Web contents. This has lead a great deal of packages to
be published built on the <WebView /> component; each adding specific behaviors
incompatible with one another, and often reinventing the wheel.

:::note Design Goal
The ultimate goal of <Webshell /> is to **reconcile** all those scattered behaviors
by providing a universal tool to craft WebView-based components and define features.
