## Compatibility

:::important
**@formidable-webview/webshell** requires React Native 0.59+ or expo SDK 33.0+.
:::

:::important
We officially support the most up to date version of
[react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview).
There is a compatibility layer for [the deprecated WebView component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/webview) exported by
react-native, but we don't officially support it.
:::

## Prerequisites

To have a good understanding of this library capabilities, you are highly encouraged, if not already, to familiarize with the following:

- React <Term id="hoc" title="Higher Order Components"/> (HOC);
- React <Term id="hooks"/>;
- <Term id="dom" title="Document Object Model" /> (DOM).

## Motivations

With React Native becoming an incredibly popular framework to build mobile
applications, the <WebView /> component has become a central piece for many
applications relying on web contents. This has lead a great deal of packages to
be published built on the <WebView /> component; each adding specific features
incompatible with one another.

:::note Design Goal
The ultimate goal of <Webshell /> is to **reconcile** all those scattered features
by providing a universal tool to craft WebView-based components and define new behaviors.
:::

:::note Requirements

- Features must be **injectable** to comply with [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle.
- Features must be **customizable** to convey reusability.
- Features must be **well tested** to convey reliability.
