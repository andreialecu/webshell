Features can set up communication in both directions, *Web to native* and *native to Web*.
We will approach the two in distinct examples, but a feature can support both at the same time.

## Web to Native Communication

To overview Web to native communication, we will take a look at
a simplified implementation of <APIReference reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />.

A feature has two facets:

- The [Web Script](#web-script), which embodies behavior in the Web environment;
- The [Feature Class](#building-a-feature-class), which tackles integration with the shell.

:::caution disclaimer
This implementation is naive and doesn't handle inner click events. If you need such a feature, use our official <APIReference reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />.
:::

### Web Script

Let's start with the Web script, the code which will run in the <ReactReference name="WebView" type="class" />.

<SingleCodeSource source="HandleLinkPressFeature.webjs" lang="js" />

**Every Web script top declaration must be a function** taking one argument.
The shape of this argument is depicted in <APISymbolFormat reference="WebjsContext" type="interface" /> definition.
This context object is the central API to interact with the shell from the Web environment.

<APIBox reference="WebjsContext" type="interface" />

Below is the same snippet with highlighted lines each matching a different context usage:

<SingleCodeSource
  lines="5,6,11,16"
  source="HandleLinkPressFeature.webjs"
  lang="js"
/>

1. `context.options` is the result of shallow-merging `defaultOptions` with user-provided options during feature instantiation.
2. `context.postMessageToShell` will send an event which will be intercepted by the shell. If an event handler has been registered for this feature and passed as a prop to the shell, it will be invoked with the message content.
3. `context.warn` and `context.info` will send a log event to the shell when `webshellDebug` prop is set to `true`. The shell will log the message in the native environment for quick feedback during development.
4. `context.makeCallbackSafe` guarantees that any error raised in the body of the callback will be intercepted by the context API and routed to the shell for quick feedback during development.

### Building a Feature Class

<APIBox reference="FeatureBuilder" type="class" />

Now let's dive into the native-side. As you can see, the definition is relatively terse:

<DualCodeSource sourceBase="HandleLinkPressFeature" />

Below is a recap of all the symbols present in this snippet:

| Symbol                            | Description                                                                       |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `linkPressScript`                 | Behavior in the Web environment (`string`).                                       |
| `defaultOptions`                  | Default options for this feature (`object`).                                      |
| `"onDOMLinkPress"`                | The name of the handler prop which will be available in the shell (`string`).     |
| `"org.myorg/webshell.link-press"` | A unique identifier for this feature (`string`).                                  |
| `LinkPressOptions`                | [**Typescript**] The shape of options the feature class can be instantiated with. |
| `LinkPressTarget`                 | [**Typescript**] The type of payload the handler prop will receive.               |

It is also worth noting that invoking `withShellHandler` is not an option:
  1. It register the handler to the shell, otherwise events fired by the below Web script will not be routed to the corresponding handler prop (`onDOMLinkPress`).
  2. When implemented in typescript, type generation will add the shell handler name and payload type to the the feature, which will be grabbed by the resulting shell prop type.

:::important
Be advised that `linkPressScript` must be a `string`. In the snippet, we are using `babel-plugin-inline-import` to import the Web script as `string`, see the [tooling guide](./tooling);
:::

:::important
Don't forget to invoke `build` method, otherwise you'll end up with a <APIReference reference="FeatureBuilder" type="class" /> instance.

### Using the Feature

<DualCodeSource jsx sourceBase="WebViewWithOnLinkPress" />

## Native to Web Communication

Until now, we have previewed how to send messages from the Web environment to the shell.
Let's say we now want to pass an `apiToken` prop to our Web script so that it
execute some authentication logic when the controlling component prop changes.

To allow communication from the shell to the Web environment, we will need to do the following:

- Declare a Web handler during at building;
- Register a handler in the Web script;
- Use a <APIReference reference="WebHandle" type="alias" /> from the shell to send `apiTokens`.

### Declaring Web Handler

We need to register a handler associated with the feature to allow the
shell to convey messages to the appropriate destination.
Let's use <APIReference reference="FeatureBuilder" type="class" member="withWebHandler" /> to declare a Web handler.
The handler will need an identifier, `'apiTokenChange'`, to disambiguate from multiple messages.

<DualCodeSource sourceBase="FeatureWithToken" />

### Registering the Web Handler

Now we need to do something with the token.
We will use <APIReference reference="WebjsContext" type="interface" member="onShellMessage" /> to register a listener function.

:::important
The first argument, `'apiTokenChange'`, must match the first argument of `withWebHandler`.
:::

<SingleCodeSource source="FeatureWithToken.webjs" lang="js" />

### Using the Feature

Finally, we need to pass the token from the shell to the Web script.
We will use <APIReference reference="WebshellInvariantProps" type="interface" member="webHandleRef" /> to imperatively send messages:

<DualCodeSource jsx sourceBase="APIComponent" />

That's it. Our Web script is almost a React component now, it can _react_ to prop changes!

:::tip
If your script relies on multiple props, it is best advised for performance and synchronization concerns to use one `useEffect` with a payload comprising all props.
:::

:::caution
Make sure to follow the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) and declare dependencies accordingly in `useEffect`:
- Declaring no dependencies will cause the effect callback to execute on every render cycle, which might jam the native to Web communication bus;
- Missing dependencies could cause [stale closures](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-hooks-stale-closures/) and inconsistencies.

## Testing with Jest

Let's go back to our `HandleLinkPressFeature` and implement a simple test.

### Install Ersatz and Testing Library

To test injected scripts, the best way is to use
[`@formidable-webview/ersatz`](https://github.com/formidable-webview/ersatz).
It will mock the WebView and run a Web environment in [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).

<InstallPackageSnippet
  dev
  packages="@testing-library/react-native @formidable-webview/ersatz @formidable-webview/ersatz-testing"
/>

### Implementing Tests

<DualCodeSource jsx sourceBase="HandleLinkPressFeature.test" />

## Web-Engines Compatibility

For wide compatibility purposes **of the Web script**, it is recommended to:

- enforce ECMAScript 5 syntax with ESlint;
- lint the script with the
  [eslint-plugin-compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-compat) to
  enforce backward compatibility with old engines;

See the [tooling guide](./tooling) for more details on how to achieve this.
