Craft <WebView />-based components which heights automatically and dynamically adapts to their page
content heights, anytime the <Term id="DOM" /> changes.

## Highlights

<AsideShowcaseFrame url="/img/autoheight-screencast.mp4">


<APIBox reference="useAutoheight" type="function" />

- The **width** of the <Term id="viewport" /> will grow to the
  available horizontal space and won't need to be specified. You can
  override this behavior by setting explicit `width` as a
  parameter attribute of <APIReference reference="useAutoheight" type="function" /> hook.
- The **height** of the <Term id="viewport" /> will dynamically adapts to the **content height**, which has
  been constrained by the <Term id="viewport" /> **width** as we have just mentioned! It
  means that anytime the content changes or the <Term id="viewport" /> width changes,
  such as in screen rotations, the <Term id="viewport" /> height will get updated.

  Look at the screen and notice in the top console how <Term id="viewport" /> height closely follows **content** height updates.

- This hook will rely on <APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" /> to use the best API
  available in the browser
  **and dynamically adapt <Term id="viewport" /> to content size**. In
  order of preference,
  [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver),
  [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
  and finally, polling on a regular interval.

:::note
You can interchangeably replace "<Term id="viewport" /> size" with "<WebView/>
size" in the above description, if that makes more sense to you.

## Basic Example

Invoke <APIReference reference="useAutoheight" type="function" /> in a controlling component and pass returned props to a shell in order to benefit from autoheight behavior.
As previously stated, it
requires _a minima_ injection of a <APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" /> in the shell to fetch content dimensions:

<DualCodeSource
  jsx
  titleBase="MinimalAutoheightWebView"
  sourceBase={'minimal-autoheight'}
/>

## Caveats and their Workarounds

### Mobile Virtual Viewport

In some circumstances, the mobile browser might use a virtual
viewport much larger then the available width in the <WebView />, often
around 980px for websites which have been built for desktop. For
this autoheight component to be reliable, you must ensure that the
content has a [meta viewport element](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp)
in the header.

:::tip solution
This can be enforced by setting responsive layout with <APIReference reference="ForceResponsiveViewportFeature" type="variable" />.

```js {4}
const Webshell = makeWebshell(
  WebView,
  new HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature(),
  new ForceResponsiveViewportFeature({ maxScale: 1 })
);
```

However, the result might be ugly and overflow on the horizontal axis if the page is not responsive (optimized for mobile).
Always make sure the content is optimized for mobile, [read more about this here](https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/responsive-design).

### Cyclic Size Constraints &infin;

<AsideShowcaseFrame url="/img/autoheight-regression-screencast.mp4">


Because the **viewport height** now depends on **content heigh**, you must never have a **body** element
height depending on viewport height, such as:

```css title="evil.css"
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
```

<div
  className="margin-bottom--md"
  style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
  or
</div>

```css title="evil.css"
body {
  height: 100%;
}
```

That is an evil cyclic dependency ready to cast an infinite loop!
Wikipedia website has such styles. Watch the console on top of screen and
notice how the shell is caught in an infinite loop shrinking the height
inexorably.

</AsideShowcaseFrame>


:::tip solution
Body width and height can be forced to
**auto** with <APIReference reference="ForceElementSizeFeature" type="variable" />.

```js {4,5,6,7}
const Webshell = makeWebshell(
  WebView,
  new HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature(),
  new ForceElementSizeFeature({
    target: 'body',
    heightValue: 'auto',
    widthValue: 'auto'
  })
);
```

## Robust Example

In this example, we use the two tips listed in above Caveats section to provide a much resilient implementation.

<DualCodeSource
  jsx
  titleBase="ResilientAutoheightWebView"
  sourceBase="resilient-autoheight"
/>

## Integration with ScrollView

More often than not, an autoheight feature is needed to embed the <WebView /> along with
content of unpredictable length, and a <ReactReference name="ScrollView" type="class" /> works just fine.
This section summarize best practices and tricks for a perfect integration.

### Recommended ScrollView Props Values

| Prop                  | Value   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pinchGestureEnabled` | `false` | Enabling pinch (the default) will conflict with the pinch-to-zoom feature provided by <APIReference reference="ForceResponsiveViewportFeature" type="variable" /> `maxScale` option. When `maxScale` is above `1`, it will allow for pinch to zoom gestures up to the provided zoom level. |
| `horizontal`          | `false` | When the Web page is ill-designed (not-responsive), the content might overflows horizontally. We suggest to avoid nesting components providing scroll in the same direction, unless necessary.                                                                                             |

### Handling `hashchange` Events

However, scroll to hash on link press, for example:

```html
<a href="#head">go to top</a>
```

will not work, because the underlying <WebView /> will not have vertical scroll anymore.

:::tip solution
You can register a prop to listen to [haschange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event) events with <APIReference reference="HandleHashChangeFeature" type="variable" />.

```jsx {4}
const Webshell = makeWebshell(
  WebView,
  new HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature(),
  new HandleHashChangeFeature({ shouldResetHashOnEvent: true })
);
```

:::

After that, you must implement the desired behavior, that is to scroll to the
desired <Term id="DOM" /> element when a `hashchange` event is fired, while accounting for the space
occupied by components above the shell, inside the <ReactReference name="ScrollView" type="class" />. Below is a complete
example:

<DualCodeSource
  jsx
  sourceBase="scrollview"
  titleBase="AutoheightWebViewInScrollView"
/>
