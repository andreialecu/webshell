## Install

<InstallPackageSnippet packages="@formidable-webview/webshell" />

## How does it work?

@formidable-webview/webshell exports a simple builder-function (<Term id="HOC" />) which
creates an augmented <WebView /> component with additional <Term id="DOM" />-based features. The returned
component behaves exactly like a <WebView />, and given a `ref` prop, you'll get
the underlying <WebView /> instance and be able to access its imperative methods.

The only difference with a vanilla <WebView /> is that this new component (from now on, we'll call it *the shell*)
will have additional props.

The <Term id="DOM" /> features form an abstraction layer over <WebView />'s <Term id="messaging system" />,
hence the “shell” in <Webshell />. Each <Term id="DOM" />
feature augments the <WebView /> with new props and behaviors.

And you can, of course, [implement any DOM feature you'd
like](./implementing-features). This library also presents a set of good
practices to test features in isolation and, by extension, test any injected
scripts. See [the tooling guide](./tooling).

## What is a Feature?

### Definition

In the context of <Webshell />, a feature is like a plugin. It encapsulates
behaviors injectable into <WebView />s. More precisely, a feature can do the
following things:

- Alter the content of the <Term id="DOM" />;
- Inject behaviors through scripts in the <Term id="DOM" />;
- Add handler props to the <WebView /> component in order to react to specific events. These features are called _event features_.

Event features will augment the <WebView/> with <Term id="DOM" /> message
handler props, for example `onDOMLinkPress`. Here are examples of event features you
can instantiate in a shell:

- Intercept click events on anchors and optionally prevent navigation (<APIReference reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />);
- Get notified when the page content size changes (<APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" />);

## What is a Shell?

This library exposes one landmark function, <APIReference reference="makeWebshell" type="function" />, a <Term id="HOC"/>
which **augments** a <WebView /> passed as first argument with features passed
as remaining arguments.

<APIBox reference="makeWebshell" type="function" />

Features are classes customizable during instantiation, where you can pass an
object of options to their constructor. Sometimes, a feature options object
might not have required fields, and you can skip the constructor argument if
you are OK with the defaults.

In the bellow snippet,
we are creating a component which augments <WebView /> with the two features
previously mentioned, but of course any number of features could be instantiated!

```js
const Webshell = makeWebshell(
  WebView,
  new HandleLinkPressFeature({ preventDefault: true }),
  new HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature({ forceImplementation: 'mutation' })
);
```

:::note
We will use the word _shell_ as an alias to instances of <APIReference reference="WebshellComponent" type="alias" /> produced
by <APIReference reference="makeWebshell" type="function" /> function.
:::

The injected features will add two props to the shell, which already supports all <WebView /> props:

- `onDOMLinkPress`
- `onDOMHTMLDimensions`

Now it's time to try out this code in a complete example.

## Minimal Example

:::caution
This example is shown for didactic purposes. If you need an autoheight <WebView/>
, <a href="./autoheight">read the guide dedicated to <APISymbolFormat reference="useAutoheight" type="function" /> hook</a> which is an order of magnitude more robust.
:::

The below example will benefit from two features to implement the following behaviors:

- Open external links in the system browser, thanks to <APIReference reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />;
- Automatically adjust <Term id="viewport" /> height with content height, thanks to <APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" />.

<DualCodeSource jsx sourceBase="basic" titleBase="NaiveAutoheightWebView" />

As you can see, each feature has added one event handler prop to the shell,
`onDOMLinkPress` and `onDOMHTMLDimensions`. When the <Term id="DOM" /> is
loaded, the two features scripts are executed and register handlers to communicate with the shell:

- `onDOMLinkPress` is invoked when the user clicks on anchors. The above implementation opens links to system browser thanks to React Native <ReactReference name="Linking" type="variable" /> API.
- `onDOMHTMLDimensions` is invoked when the page content size changes. The above implementation stores this size in a local state and injects it to the shell `style` prop. We have just created a naive Autoheight WebView!
