import { WebView } from '../components/ReactReference';
import { APIReference } from '../components/APIReference';

## How can I get the `ref` of the <WebView />?

`Webshell` component already forwards the reference of the underlying <WebView />. Just use `ref` prop as you would with a <WebView />!

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const webViewRef = useRef(null);
  return <Webshell ref={webViewRef} />
}
```

## Will a Shell Pass `injectedJavaScript` Prop?

**Yes**. <APIReference reference="WebshellComponent" type="alias" /> will pass any
`injectedJavaScript` prop to the underlying <WebView/>, along with scripts
bundled from features.

## Will a Shell Account for `onMessage` Handler Prop?

**Yes**. It will intercept specific events created by features, and hoist any
message which doesn't comply to very specific requirements towards the controlling
component.
