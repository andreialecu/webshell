import { Webshell } from '../components/Webshell';

This post will be regularly updated to track the main features scheduled for <Webshell />.


## Two-way Communication

Currently, features can inject scripts which will create events, and offer props to handle those events.
What we'd like to provide is a way to communicate imperatively *from* the shell to the DOM. Something like this:

```jsx title="MyComponent.jsx"
import * as React from 'react';
const Webshell = makeWebshell(WebView, feature1);

export const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const bridge = React.useRef();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    bridge.postMessage(feature1.featureIdentifier, props.user);
  }, [props.user])
  return <Webshell bridge={bridge} />
}
```

And on the Web side:

```js title="feature1.webjs"
function feature1(context) {
  context.onMessage(function(user){
    console.info(user); // Prints user!
  });
}
```

## Feature dependencies

Provide the following capabilities:

- express dependency relationships between features;
- compose features together;
- communicate between features with an event-based system;
- specify the cardinality of a feature (how many instances can co-exist). We
  are planning to get inspiration from [multi-instance plugins in
  docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/using-plugins#multi-instance-plugins-and-plugin-ids).

## Passing props to Features

Features are already customizable with options, which are once-and-for-all
delivered as an argument of the feature function. But what about providing
dynamic attributes which sync with shell props?
