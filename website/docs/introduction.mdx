## Motivations

With React Native becoming an incredibly popular framework to build mobile
applications, the <WebView /> component has become a central piece for many
applications relying on web contents. This has lead a great deal of packages to
be published built on the <WebView /> component; each being incompatible with one
another.

:::note Design Goal
The ultimate goal of <Webshell /> is to **reconcile** all those scattered features
by providing a universal tool to craft WebView-based components.
:::

## Prerequisites

To have a good understanding of this library capabilities, you are highly encouraged, if not already, to familiarize with the following:

- React <Term id="hoc" title="Higher Order Components"/> (HOC);
- React <Term id="hooks"/>;
- <Term id="dom" title="Document Object Model"/> (DOM).

## How does it look?

@formidable-webview/<Webshell/> exports a simple builder-function (HOC) which
creates an augmented <WebView /> with additional <Term id="DOM" />-based features. The returned
component behaves exactly like a <WebView />, and given a `ref` prop, you'll get
the underlying <WebView /> instance and be able to access its imperative methods.

The <Term id="DOM" /> features form an abstraction layer over <WebView />'s <Term id="messaging system" />,
hence the “shell” in <Webshell />. Each <Term id="DOM" />
feature augments the <WebView /> with new props and behaviors.

And you can, of course, [implement any DOM feature you'd
like](./implementing-features). This library also presents a set of good
practices to test features in isolation and, by extension, test any injected
scripts. See [the tooling guide](./tooling).

## Requirements

:::note Requirement
Features must be **injectable**. This requirement is dictated by the need to
limit the size of bundled injected scripts and include exactly *what* is needed.
:::

:::note Requirement
Features must be **customizable** to convey reusability.
:::

:::note Requirement
Features must be **well tested** to convey reliability. We use a [collection of
tools](./tooling) to test features and ensure compatibility with older browser engines.
:::

## Compatibility

:::important
@formidable-webview/<Webshell /> requires React Native 0.59+.
:::

:::note
We officially support the most up to date version of
[react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview).
There is a compatibility layer for the deprecated WebView component exported by
react-native, but we will not take action following reports implying its usage.
