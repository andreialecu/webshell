## What is a Feature?

In the context of <Webshell />, a feature is like a plugin. It encapsulates
behaviors injectable into <WebView />s. More precisely, a feature can do the
following things:

- Alter the content of the <Term id="DOM" />;
- Inject behaviors through scripts in the <Term id="DOM" />;
- Add handler props to the <WebView /> component in order to react to specific events. These features are called *event features*.

<APIBox reference="Feature" type="alias" />

Event features will augment the <WebView/> with <Term id="DOM" /> message
handler props, for example `onDOMLinkPress`. Here are examples of event features you
can assemble in the shell:

- Intercept click events on anchors and prevent navigation (<APIReference reference="handleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />);
- Get notified when an element size changes in the view (<APIReference reference="handleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />);

See [the complete list of features here](./features).

## What is a Shell?

This library exposes one landmark function, <APIReference reference="makeWebshell" type="function" />, a <Term id="HOC"/>
which **augments** a <WebView /> passed as first argument with features passed
as remaining arguments.

<APIBox reference="makeWebshell" type="function" />

Because these features are customizable, the API requires you to assemble those
features by invoking the `assemble` method for each of these features, passing
optionally an object of options. In the bellow snippet, we are creating a
component which augments <WebView /> with two features, but in reality any number
of features could be passed!

```js
const Webshell = makeWebshell(
  WebView,
  handleLinkPressFeature.assemble({ preventDefault: true }),
  handleHTMLDimensionsFeature.assemble()
);
```

:::note
We will use the word *shell* as an alias to the <APIReference reference="WebshellComponent" type="alias" /> produced
by <APIReference reference="makeWebshell" type="function" /> function.
:::

The injected features will add two props to the shell, which already supports all <WebView /> props:

- `onDOMLinkPress`
- `onDOMHTMLDimensions`

We will discuss those two features in details in the next section.
