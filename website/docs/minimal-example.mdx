import { Webshell } from '../components/Webshell';
import { Term } from '../components/Term';
import { APIReference } from '../components/APIReference';
import { APIBox } from '../components/APIBox';
import { WebView } from '../components/ReactReference';
import { DualCodeSource, SingleCodeSource } from '../components/CodeSource';
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

:::important
This example is shown for didactic purposes. If you need an autoheight <WebView />, [read the dedicated guide](./autoheight).
:::

The below example will benefit from two features to implement the following behaviors:

- Open external links in the system browser, thanks to <APIReference reference="HandleLinkPressFeature" type="variable" />;
- Automatically adjust <Term id="viewport" /> height with content height, thanks to <APIReference reference="HandleHTMLDimensionsFeature" type="variable" />.

<DualCodeSource jsx sourceBase="basic" titleBase="NaiveAutoheightWebView" />

As you can see, each feature has added two event handler props to the shell, `onDOMLinkPress` and `onDOMHTMLDimensions`.

:::important
We highly recommend the convention to start handler prop names with `onDOM` to avoid collisions with <ReactReference name="WebView" type="class" /> own props.
See how to implement your own features [in the dedicated guide](/docs/implementing-features).
