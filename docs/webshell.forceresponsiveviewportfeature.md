## forceResponsiveViewportFeature variable

This feature inserts or replace a `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />` tag in the head to guarantee that the layout viewport will match device-width (hence, “responsive”). Minimum scale is locked to 1, but you can customize maximum scale to allow pinch-zoom gestures. See [MDN—Using the viewport meta tag ...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag)
